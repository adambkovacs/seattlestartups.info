faq:
  - question: "Which Seattle area county should I start my startup in?"
    answer: "It depends on your industry. King County (Seattle/Eastside) is best for AI, tech, and life sciences. Pierce County (Tacoma) specializes in maritime, maker culture, and BIPOC entrepreneurship. Snohomish focuses on aerospace and manufacturing. Kitsap connects to defense contracting. Thurston offers policy access and micro-lending."
  - question: "What is the Seattle startup mesh network?"
    answer: "Greater Seattle operates as a distributed network where each county specializes in specific industries while sharing common statewide infrastructure. Founders can enter the system from any location and access resources across all 5 counties. This is called the 'no wrong door' approach."
  - question: "Where should AI startups locate in Seattle?"
    answer: "AI startups should focus on King County, specifically Seattle's AI House at Pier 70 (108,000 sq ft dedicated to AI) and the AI2 Incubator (from Allen Institute for AI). The University of Washington CoMotion Labs also supports deep tech and AI commercialization."

Greater Seattle's 5 counties have developed distinct specializations. This guide helps you pick the right home base based on what you're building.

## The Core Concept

Greater Seattle operates as a distributed network, not a single hub. Each county has developed expertise in specific industries while sharing a common statewide infrastructure.

**The "no wrong door" principle:** Enter the system from any county and access resources across the entire network. A maritime startup in Tacoma can still access Seattle VC. A Seattle tech founder can plug into Kitsap's defense infrastructure.

| County | Primary Specialization |
|--------|------------------------|
| King (Seattle/Eastside) | AI, Deep Tech, Life Sciences |
| Snohomish | Aerospace, Manufacturing, BlueTech |
| Kitsap | Defense, Government Contracting, Maritime |
| Pierce (Tacoma) | Maker Culture, Maritime, BIPOC Entrepreneurship |
| Thurston (Olympia) | Policy, Agriculture, Micro-Enterprise |
