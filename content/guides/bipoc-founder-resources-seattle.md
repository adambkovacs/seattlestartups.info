Greater Seattle has **34 verified programs** specifically designed for BIPOC founders. This guide covers accelerators, funding, mentorship, and community organizations that prioritize Black, Indigenous, Latino/a, Asian, and Pacific Islander entrepreneurs.

## BIPOC Startup Resources in Seattle

Seattle's tech ecosystem has historically underrepresented BIPOC founders. These programs exist to change that reality:

| Metric | Seattle | National Average |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| VC funding to Black founders (2024) | 1.8% | 1.0% |
| BIPOC-led startups in accelerators | 22% | 15% |
| Programs specifically for BIPOC | 34 | Varies |
| Median pre-seed raise (BIPOC founders) | $185K | $150K |

The gap is closing, but dedicated programs accelerate the change.
