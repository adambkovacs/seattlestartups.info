## Step 3: Attend 1 Million Cups on Wednesday

## Step 4: Apply to One Accelerator

**Time required:** 2-4 hours for application

Apply to an accelerator before you think you're ready. Most founders wait too long.

**Best first accelerators by stage:**

| Your Stage | Apply To | Why |
|------------|----------|-----|
| Idea only | WTIA Founder Cohort | Free, 6 months, no equity |
| Working prototype | Startup425 | Free, 15 weeks, no equity |
| Early revenue | Techstars Seattle | $220K investment |
| Black founder | SEA619 | Free first year, 0-2% equity cap |
| Climate tech | Cascadia CleanTech | $500 fee, no equity |

**WTIA Founder Cohort details:**
- 6-month program
- Free of charge
- No equity taken
- Must be seed-stage WA tech startup
- Less than $1M annual revenue

**How to apply:**
1. Research which program fits your stage
2. Prepare a basic pitch deck (10-12 slides)
3. Apply 3-4 months before you need to start
4. Follow up after submitting

**Pro tip:** A warm introduction from an alumnus increases acceptance rates 3x. Ask your SCORE mentor for connections.

## Step 5: Register Your Business (When Ready)

**Time required:** 1-2 weeks

Don't register until you've validated your idea. Once ready, here's the process.

**When to register:**
- You're ready to accept payment
- You're signing contracts
- You're hiring employees
- You're seeking investment

**Washington State registration:**

| Step | What to Do | Cost |
|------|------------|------|
| 1. Reserve business name | WA Secretary of State | $30 |
| 2. Register your business | WA Secretary of State | $180 (LLC) |
| 3. Get UBI number | WA Dept of Revenue | Free |
| 4. Seattle business license | City of Seattle | Varies |

**LLC vs. Corporation:**
- **LLC:** Simpler, good for most early startups
- **C-Corp:** Required for VC funding, Delaware incorporation common

**Pro tip:** If you're planning to raise VC money, talk to a lawyer about Delaware C-Corp incorporation. Many Seattle startups use this structure.
