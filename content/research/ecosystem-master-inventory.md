# Greater Seattle Startup Support Ecosystem: Complete Resource Map

Early-stage founders in Greater Seattle have access to **248+ verified free resources** spanning all five target counties, with particularly strong government-backed advising networks, library systems providing premium business databases at no cost, and emerging programs specifically targeting underrepresented founders. The ecosystem's greatest strengths lie in its county-level SBDC coverage, free university programming open to community members, and a robust network of tool libraries and makerspaces offering free or pay-what-you-can access.

**Impact Hub Seattle permanently closed in mid-2020** due to COVID-19—a frequently cited resource that no longer exists. The newest additions include AI House Seattle (March 2025), Seattle Climate Innovation Hub (January 2025), and the SEA619 Black founder accelerator (August 2025).

### Gap Summary

**Geographic Gaps:**
- **Kitsap County**: Limited accelerator programs (only Matchstick Lab); no university entrepreneurship programs on peninsula; makerspace options concentrated on Bainbridge (BARN)
- **Thurston County**: Strong advising infrastructure (Thurston EDC/CB&I) but limited community event programming and founder networking groups
- **North Snohomish/South Snohomish divide**: Resources concentrated in Everett/Lynnwood; limited presence in Marysville, Arlington, Stanwood areas

**Resource Type Gaps:**
- **Wet lab space**: Very limited outside Seattle (CoMotion, Alexandria, Icogenex all in Seattle proper)
- **Hardware prototyping for startups**: Limited options beyond university access
- **Food startup infrastructure**: Spice Bridge on waitlist; limited commercial kitchen incubator capacity
- **Creative/media startup spaces**: Few dedicated facilities for video, podcast, music production startups
- **Immigrant entrepreneur services**: Strong in South King (Spice Bridge, Mi Centro) but limited elsewhere

**Inclusion Gaps:**
- **Native American/Indigenous founder programs**: Not identified in research
- **Disability-focused entrepreneur programs**: BARN companion program only; limited elsewhere
- **Rural entrepreneur programs**: WTIA explicitly targets rural but few other dedicated rural resources
