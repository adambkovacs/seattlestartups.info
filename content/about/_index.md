## Our Origin Story

I spent six weeks hunting for startup resources when I first landed in Seattle. Six. Weeks.

The information existed—scattered across city economic development pages, buried in university PDFs, hidden in LinkedIn groups, and locked behind email newsletters nobody actually reads.

So I built what I needed: **one place with everything**.

## What We Actually Do

We maintain a verified directory of **248+ free resources** across the Greater Seattle metro area. Every listing meets strict criteria before publication.

### Our Verification Standards

| Requirement | What We Check |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Official URL** | Links to resource owner or authoritative host |
| **Clear Owner** | Identifiable organization stands behind the offer |
| **Specific Offer** | Concrete description—not vague "support for founders" language |
| **Access Path** | Clear next step: apply, register, attend, or contact |
| **Geographic Proof** | Confirmed service area within Greater Seattle |
| **Active Status** | Verified within the last 12 months |

### How We Classify Resources

Resources get one of three proof-of-life ratings:

1. **Government Evergreen** — Stable public services with persistent budget allocations (SBDC offices, library programs, state agencies)
2. **Active Program** — Current cohort deadlines, scheduled events, or open applications visible on the site
3. **Recent Activity** — Official site shows updates within the past 12 months

## What We Won't List

We have a simple filter: **if founders have to pay, it's not here**.

This means we exclude:

- Programs with tuition, fees, or subscription costs
- Accelerators that take equity (that's payment)
- Pay-to-play directories and sponsored listings
- Affiliate or referral-driven content
- Anything we can't independently verify

Zero exceptions. We don't monetize this directory.

## Coverage by County

Our focus is the Greater Seattle metropolitan area—what locals call the Puget Sound region.

| County | Major Cities | Resources |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **King** | Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland | 80+ |
| **Pierce** | Tacoma, Lakewood, Puyallup | 24+ |
| **Snohomish** | Everett, Lynnwood, Edmonds | 16+ |
| **Thurston** | Olympia, Lacey, Tumwater | 14+ |
| **Kitsap** | Bremerton, Silverdale, Poulsbo | 10+ |

Resource counts change as we verify new listings and retire inactive ones.

## About the Maintainer

This project is built and maintained by **Adam Kovacs**, a Seattle-based technologist who got tired of answering "where do I find X?" for every founder friend who moved here.

I also run the [AI Enablement Academy](https://aienablementacademy.com), help organize [OPEN Talent Society](https://opentalentsociety.org), and occasionally post useful things on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adambkovacs/).

The code lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/adambkovacs/seattlestartups.info). Feel free to fork it, improve it, or tell me what's broken.
