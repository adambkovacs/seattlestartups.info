# About This Project

## The Problem

Early-stage founders in the Greater Seattle area lack a single, reliable place to discover the full set of startup-relevant support resources. Information is fragmented across:

- Municipal economic development offices
- County and state agencies
- Nonprofit organizations
- Universities and community colleges
- Community groups and event platforms

## The Solution

**seattlestartups.info** provides a comprehensive, verified inventory of **170+ free resources** that can be published and maintained by the community.

## Methodology

### Verification Standards

Every published record includes:
- Official URL (resource owner or authoritative host)
- Identifiable owner organization
- Clear offer description
- Clear access path
- Geography evidence
- Last verified date
- Proof-of-life category

### Proof-of-Life Categories

- **Government Evergreen** — Stable public services with persistent funding
- **Current Dates Present** — Active cohort deadlines or scheduled events
- **Recent Update** — Official site updated within 12 months

### Exclusions

We do NOT include:
- Paid programs (fees, tuition, equity requirements)
- Unverified listings
- Pay-to-play directories
- Affiliate/referral content
