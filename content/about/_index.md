## About Me

I'm **Adam Kovacs**, based in Seattle. I got tired of searching for answers to "where do I find X in the Greater Seattle Area?" questions.

I'm the Co-Founder of [AI Enablement Academy](https://aienablementacademy.com), Executive Director of [OPEN Talent Society](https://opentalentsociety.org), and occasionally post useful things on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adambkovacs/).

The code lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/adambkovacs/seattlestartups.info). Feel free to fork it, improve it, or tell me what's broken.
