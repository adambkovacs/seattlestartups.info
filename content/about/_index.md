## What This Directory Does

I maintain a verified directory of **248+ free resources** across the Greater Seattle metro area.

### How Resources Get Listed

| Requirement | What I Check |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Official URL** | Links to resource owner or authoritative host |
| **Clear Owner** | Identifiable organization stands behind the offer |
| **Specific Offer** | Concrete description—not vague "support for founders" language |
| **Access Path** | Clear next step: apply, register, attend, or contact |
| **Geographic Proof** | Confirmed service area within Greater Seattle |
| **Active Status** | Verified within the last 12 months |

---

## What's Not Listed

Simple filter: **if founders have to pay, it's not here**.

This means I exclude:

- Programs with tuition, fees, or subscription costs
- Accelerators that take equity (that's payment)
- Pay-to-play directories and sponsored listings
- Affiliate or referral-driven content
- Anything I can't independently verify

Zero exceptions. I don't monetize this directory.

## Coverage by County

The focus is the Greater Seattle metropolitan area—what locals call the Puget Sound region.

| County | Major Cities | Resources |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **King** | Seattle, Bellevue, Redmond, Kirkland | 80+ |
| **Pierce** | Tacoma, Lakewood, Puyallup | 24+ |
| **Snohomish** | Everett, Lynnwood, Edmonds | 16+ |
| **Thurston** | Olympia, Lacey, Tumwater | 14+ |
| **Kitsap** | Bremerton, Silverdale, Poulsbo | 10+ |

Resource counts change as I verify new listings and retire inactive ones.
